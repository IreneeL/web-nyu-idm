# Object Meditation Van Gogh Watercolor Pan

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of this object?
- friendship
- adventure
- courage
- chaos
- random

### Are there spatial places this object is associated with?
- Probably my work desk, because that is where I'll use this object the most. And the art classroom in my high school. I used to bring my own art material to class to work on my projects.

### What does my object look like?
- It's wrapped in a blue metal case, so it is quite heavy. Inside is 24 half watercolor pans and a brush that I put in. There is also a metal plate for mixing colors which is now very messy because I have not cleaned it. On the back side of the metal cover, I also use it as a mixing plate because it is quite handy.

### feel like?
- cold, heavy, very hard.

### smell like?
- emmmmmmmmm I don't smell anything from watercolor

### sound like?
- metal tapping sound, sounds pretty good in a way.

### Where did you get it?
- In China, because it's cheaper than Amazon(for all the tax and handling fees, this brand was from Netherlands).

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
- happy, but also upset. Because I asked my sister to brought it back from China for me along with an expensive watercolor brush(she was traveling to China). But she brought the watercolor back but forgot the brush in hotel. So I had to buy another one here in NY.

### Why did you choose it?
- My friend recommended it to me. And I used her set of watercolor before it was definitely an upgrade from the one I used to had.

### What do you see in your objects what no one else could see?
- My hair and dark circles from staying up late painting.

### Is it one of a kind?
-No, you can get it easily from any art store.

### How do you interact with it?
- Open it, wet the brush, and mix color to get the one you want, then paint on watercolor paper.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with? Who are its friends?
- Paint brushes and watercolor papers that I use along with it. I also use my laptop to search up image for reference when I paint.

### What are specific memories you have with is object?
- High school fun times with a friend that we used to draw together. But now we rarely talk after I graduated. And I also don't paint a lot now in college because I practice digital art, everything is digitalize. I definitely miss the times when I would spent few hours sitting down in one spot and just paint.
