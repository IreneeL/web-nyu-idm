    <h2>The story of my name</h2>

    <p style="font-size:25px; color:DodgerBlue">
      I used to use my Chinese name in schools.
    </p>


    <p style="color:FireBrick;">Then one day,</p>

    <p style="color:Gold;">
      I was told by my mother to choose a English name for myself before going into high school so I can fit in with others.
    </p>

    <b style="font-size:35px; color:DodgerBlue">I don't know what to do.</b>

    <p style="font-size:27px; color:SeaGreen;">So I googled names for girls and wrote down a list of names and gave it to my friends to choose the one that suits me.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:FireBrick;">And eventually that is how I got my English name.</h3>

    <p style="font-size:20px">btw the name is Irene :)</p>
