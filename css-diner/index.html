  <!-- I made a page about the 5 favorite drinks I usually get from starbucks -->

  <h1>What is my Top 5 favorite drinks from starbucks? ü§î</h1>

  <br><br><br>

    <div class="fifth">
      <h2> 5. tall Caff√® Americano with extra shots </h2>
      <p class="reason"> I often brought it when I stayed up late the night before because it helps me
        <br> reduce the puffiness on my face and makes me stay awake in class. </p>
      <p1> aka college lifesaver </p1> 
      <br>

    </div>

    <div class="fourth">
      <h2> 4. Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate </h2>
      <p class="reason"> It's just a nice hot drink to have in the winter. </p>
      <img src="images/salted.jpg">
    <div>

    <div class="third">
      <h2> 3. Caramel Brulee Latte </h2>
      <p class="reason"> I am someone who loves sweet things.
        <br> Therefore a caramel brulee latte would definitely bring my mood up :). </p>

    <div>

    <div class="second">
      <h2> 2. Matcha Green Tea Cr√®me Frappuccino <br> with EXTRAAAA whipped cream</h2>
      <p class="reason"> I just can't think of a reason why someone wouldn't like this.</p>
      <img src="images/frap.jpg">
      <p> (p.s.if you order a grande frappuccino and ask them to put it in a venti cup,
           you will get the same amount of drink but with half a cup of cream on top ;)</p>
    <div>

    <div class="first">
      <h2> 1. Iced Matcha Green Tea Latte </h2>
      <h1> MY FAVORITE!</h1>
      <p class="reason"> This is just my all time favorite. MATCHA NO.1 </p>
      <p> (I recently discovered a new way for ordering this:
            light iced+soy milk+salted cream in a venti cup. <br>
            The salted cream is soul.
            LOVED IT) </p> <br>
